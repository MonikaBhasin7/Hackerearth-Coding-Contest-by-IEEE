JB is a software developer.
He likes to spend time programming on his laptop.
He can program continuously for hours but he needs energy drinks to avoid sleep.
He is an interesting person. He finds that there is a strong relationship between the energy drinks and the number of lines of code he writes.(Strange isn't it)
He has energy drinks and bottles of different size.
He noticed that he can write at least 2^jXk(where j is the number of bottles of energy drink he has already consumed and k is the amount of energy drink present in the (j+1)th bottle) lines of code.

Given the amount in ml for each energy drink bottle, you need to find the minimum number of lines of code JB will write.
JB can take energy drink bottle in any order.

Input
The first line contains an integer, n denoting the number of bottles of energy drinks. 
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective amount of energy drink in ml present in each bottle.

Output
Print a minimum lines of code JB can write.

Constraints
1 ≤ n ≤ 40(Yes, JB can drink up to 40 bottles of energy drink)
1 ≤ k ≤ 1000
