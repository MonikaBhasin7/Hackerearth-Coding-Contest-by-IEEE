JB is just another programmer who tries his best to solve some problems around him using Algorithms of Machine Learning.
He collects data from each and every source and tries to bring out meaning out of it.
The dataset that he plays around with usually have millions of data points and sometimes billions!
To run algorithms on such large datasets he wants to build his own Computer.
He decided to attach GPUs to the Computer.
He finally estimates that the total cost needed to make the computer is in million dollars.
Now comes the major problem.
He is just a computer science undergraduate so the cost to make a powerful computer is high for him.
JB decided to work on some projects to meet the cost.
He sends email to thousands of managers of different companies about taking up a project.
Next day his inbox is flooded with project description along with the stipend.
He decided to take up multiple projects to collect more money.
He decided that he would select a project in such a way that if a project is selected then the project before it in his inbox is rejected.
This is a kind of rolling decision.

Can you help him in selecting the projects in the manner described above?
Also, try to maximize the total money he earns.

Input
The first line of input contains the number of test cases (t).
Each test case starts with a number N denoting the number of projects.
Next line will have N numbers (stipend each project offers)
Projects are described in the order they are mailed.

Output
For each test case print “Case i: j” without quotes.
i is the case number, starting with 1. j is the max money he makes.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 100
0 <= N <= 10000
0 <= Stipend of each project (in Vietnamese Dong) <= 10^12
