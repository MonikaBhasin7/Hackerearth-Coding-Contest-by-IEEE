There are different situations in a Software Engineer's life.
They sleep, play, write code, Study, Research, Attend college, Eat food and talk to friends.
Sometimes they are happy and sometimes they are sad.
Software Engineers are happy when they sleep, play, eat food and talk to friends.
There are some nerds in the category of Software Engineers.
They have different defination of happiness.

They are happy when they are involved in awesome Research work or when they are coding(They live to code most of the time).
But there are lot of distractions that don't let them continue their research work or coding.
Thus, they cannot be happy all the time.That's life.

Over the time these nerds learn to control their emotions.
They are either sad on a day or happy on a day but they never have mixed feelings.

Coding and Research work for nerds doesn't end after college.
It goes life long!

One such nerd started doing analysis of his happiness.
He wants to remain happy for atleast M days out of N days otherwise people will think he is alien.
He wants to make a software that would tell him that in how many ways he can be happy in M days.
He made the UI of software and he has asked you to write a program for it.

Remember number of ways can be large so take modulo with (10^9+7)

Input:
The first line of the input contains T, denoting the number of test cases.
The next T lines contain two space-separated integers N and M.

Output:
For each test-case, output a single integer.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^6
1 ≤ M ≤ 10^6
M ≤ N
