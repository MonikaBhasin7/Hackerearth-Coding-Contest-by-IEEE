Paras is good at heart.
He is saying money to help a needy person.
The need person lives in a small room which is located at the corner of a big single story house.
The entrance door to the house is present in another corner diagonally opposite to the needy person's room.

The big house has a lot of rooms which are joined to one another.
In each room there are children.
The only way to reach a needy person is to go through a path from these rooms.

Since Paras is good at heart so he wants to give away 1 candy to each child who he meets while going to the needy person.
He has a fixed amount of money.
If he meets more children then he had to take more candies so that each child gets one.
But that will reduce the money with Paras and eventually he would not be able to help the needy person much.
Let's say Paras enters the house then he can only move down, right, and diagonally down considering the top view of the single-story building.

You are a good programmer.
Paras wants your help.
Look for a path in such a way that he meets minimum children.
In this way, Paras will buy fewer candies and he can help the needy person more.
Please tell Paras how many candies should he buy. 

Input format :
Two integers, a and b where (aXb) represents the number of rooms in the house.

A single integer denoting the number of candies Paras should buy

Constraints :

1 <= a, b <= 99

1<= Number of children in each room <= 50000
